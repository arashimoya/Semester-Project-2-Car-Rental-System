<h1>Car Rental System</h1>

This application serves the employees of a car rental company as the primary hub to store and keep track of cars they are currently offering and to rent them out to customers based on the customer's order. Cars, branches and employees can be added, edited or removed. The application utilizes 2-tier architecture and so the data is sent using RMI to the second tier of the application where it is stored to the database and returned when needed.

The project was designed and developed in a group using Java, JavaFX, CSS, PostgreSQL and the Scrum Development Methodology
